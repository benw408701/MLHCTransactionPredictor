			Liens (number)
			Audit Entries (number)
			Total Notes
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)

Export 7: Take export 6 and also remove coverage type and product
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Liens (number)
			Audit Entries (number)
			Total Notes
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Better, can train down to 6.6% error after 6,000 training cycles, better than reached before.
			 The error rate on the cancellations appears to be much better than on the closed files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Future trials will involve averaging the number of notes and audit entries into a daily
average rather than using the total number.

Export 8: Original Export, average notes and audit entries daily
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Office (value)
			Coverage Type (value)
			State (value)
			Product (value)
			Transaction (value)
			Loan Amount (number)
			Lien Amounts (number)
			Equity (number)
			Liens (number)
			Actions (number)
			Audit Entries per Day (number)
			Total Exceptions (number)
			Total Notes per Day (number)
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Poor

Export 9: Take export 8 and remove office, state, product, lien amounts, equity, exceptions
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Coverage Type (value)
			Transaction (value)
			Loan Amount (number)
			Liens (number)
			Actions (number)
			Audit Entries per Day (number)
			Total Notes per Day (number)
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Reached 5% error after 3,268 training cycles. 3.85% after 6,000 cycles
			 Tried again with 5 hidden nodes (normally 3) and reached 3.9% after 6,000 cycles.
			 Tried again with 4 hidden nodes and had the same results.
			 1 hidden node: 4% after 6,000 cycles
			 2 hidden nodes: 3.89% after 6,000 cycles
			 Ran 50,000 cycles and reached 3.13% error. Validation set had 3.51% error
			 Ran 100,000 cycles and saved train9.eg

Export 10: Take export 9 and remove actions but add back in product
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Coverage Type (value)
			Product (value)
			Transaction (value)
			Loan Amount (number)
			Liens (number)
			Audit Entries per Day (number)
			Total Notes per Day (number)
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Terminated at 9% because validation set wasn't improving

Export 11: Take export 10 and remove product
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Coverage Type (value)
			Transaction (value)
			Loan Amount (number)
			Liens (number)
			Audit Entries per Day (number)
			Total Notes per Day (number)
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Couldn't get error rate under 4.5%

Export 12: Same as export 9, but the coverage type is a text string rather than an id number. Random sorted the rows in the input data
	Inputs: File Number (skip)
			Coverage Type (value)
			Transaction (value)
			Loan Amount (number)
			Liens (number)
			Actions (number)
			Audit Entries per Day (number)
			Total Notes per Day (number)
	Outputs: Cancelled (number)
			 Num Days to Close (number)
	Results: Randomization of input data seems to have made the validation set and training set error rates much closer. I think
			 that the data was previously ordered by close date and various transaction types weren't distributed evenly.
			 At 100,000 training iterations error rate is at 2.8%
			 Saving as train12.eg
